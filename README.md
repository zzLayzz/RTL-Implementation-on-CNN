# RTL-Implementation-on-CNN
This project showcases the design, optimization, and hardware implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on an Intel Cyclone V FPGA. It tackles key challenges in CNN deployment—such as high computational cost, memory usage, and power consumption—using model compression (pruning + quantization) and a hardware-software co-design strategy.
